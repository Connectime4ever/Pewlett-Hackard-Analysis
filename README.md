# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The client requests to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 
Additionally, a report should summarize the analysis performed and help management to be prepared for the upcomming massive retirement of their employees which are reaching their retirement age.

## Results

+ There are 7 titles the client needs to focus on for future replacements. 

+ The human resources situation of the client requires inmediate attention as more than 70% of the retiring employees are those most skilled and high tech employees (25916 **Senior** Engineer and 24926 **Senior** staff )

+ The Engineer title will be the most impacted position with the massive retirement (25916 Senior Engineers and 9285 Engineers). 

+ Another highly demanded title to be filled is the Staff with 24926 Senior Staff and 7636 Staff, masively retiring.

+ Apparently Manager titles should not  represent any challenge for the client as only 2 are retiring. It could be an opportuntiy to promote tallent inside the organization.
